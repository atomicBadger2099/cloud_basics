SSH NOTES

SSH is a way of maintaining signin security using encrypted public and private key pairs.
The public key pair can always be shown. The private key pair may never be revealed or it 
will break the security of the key pair.

Be careful where you put backups of keys.
Remember that once a key is in place, it now controls the signin of a credential.
If you mess up the keys, administrative help is needed one step up to change it.


key types:
	RSA (most common)
	ecdsa (compact)
	Ed25519 (most modern - performant in use)


KEY GENERATION COMMANDS:
	powershell command for generating a RSA key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
	linux command for generating a RSA key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
	powershell command for generating a ecdsa key: ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
	linux command for generating a ecdsa key: ssh-keygen -t ecdsa
	powershell command for generating a Ed25519 key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_comment_here"
	linux command for generating a Ed25519 key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_comment_here"

Name your files accordingly so they do not save over top of other keys and accidentally destroy them.
